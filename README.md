# ProjectPulse - Project Progress Monitoring App Design

## Key Features:

### 1. Dashboard
- **Overview**: Provides a snapshot of ongoing projects with progress bars, deadlines, and alerts.
- **Key Metrics**: Display KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) like completed tasks, pending tasks, overdue tasks, and resource allocation.
- **Timeline**: Gantt chart or calendar to visualize the project’s lifecycle with task dependencies.

### 2. Project Management
- **Create New Project**: Initiate new projects with details like start date, end date, team members, and milestones.
- **Tasks**: Break the project into manageable tasks or subtasks. Tasks should have:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Start Date
  - End Date
  - Assigned Team Members
  - Priority Level (Low, Medium, High)
  - Status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
- **Milestones**: Set significant project milestones with deadlines to track progress.

### 3. Task Management
- **Task List**: Display all tasks with filters like due date, priority, and completion status.
- **Task Dependencies**: Allow setting task dependencies so certain tasks can’t start before others finish.
- **Time Tracking**: Option to track the time spent on each task for better productivity insights.

### 4. Team Collaboration
- **Team Members**: Add/remove team members with their roles and permissions.
- **Comments & Updates**: Each task or project should have a comment section for updates, discussions, and file attachments.
- **Notifications**: Alerts for task updates, deadlines, and comments.

### 5. Progress Visualization
- **Gantt Chart**: Visual representation of tasks, their dependencies, and milestones over time.
- **Kanban Board**: Board-style task management where tasks are categorized by their progress status (To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Progress Reports**: Weekly or monthly reports showing the progress of tasks and overall project health.

### 6. Time Tracking & Reporting
- **Time Log**: Track how much time each team member spends on a task.
- **Progress Reports**: Generate reports that provide insights into project progress, task completion rates, and team productivity.
- **Burn-down Chart**: Chart showing the remaining work versus time, ideal for agile project management.

### 7. Integration
- **Google Calendar/Outlook**: Sync deadlines and meetings.
- **GitHub/Jira**: Sync project management with code repositories and other project management tools.
- **Slack/Microsoft Teams**: Notifications for project updates and task assignments.

### 8. Mobile Access
- **Responsive Design**: The app should be accessible via mobile devices for team members on the go.
- **Push Notifications**: Ensure users get real-time updates on tasks and deadlines via push notifications.

### 9. Security
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Restrict access based on user roles such as Admin, Project Manager, Team Member, and Viewer.
- **Data Encryption**: Ensure all communication and stored data is encrypted to protect sensitive project information.

### 10. Customization & Settings
- **Custom Fields**: Allow project managers to add custom fields relevant to their project.
- **Dark Mode/Light Mode**: UI themes for better user experience.

## Tech Stack:

### 1. Frontend:
- **React.js/Next.js** for fast, responsive UI.
- **MUI (Material UI)** or **Shadcn** for consistent and user-friendly design components.
- **D3.js** or **Chart.js** for data visualization (progress, Gantt charts).

### 2. Backend:
- **Node.js with Express** or **Next.js API routes** for building REST APIs.
- **MongoDB** or **PostgreSQL** for data storage (projects, tasks, users, etc.).
- **JWT** for secure authentication.

### 3. Real-Time Collaboration:
- **WebSockets** (e.g., Socket.io) or **Pusher** for real-time updates on tasks and progress.

### 4. Hosting/Deployment:
- **AWS** or **Vercel** for hosting and deployment.
- **Docker** for containerized environments.

### 5. Mobile Support:
- **React Native** for a cross-platform mobile app.
